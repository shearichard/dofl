# VIRTENV
The name of the development vm is dofl37.

Using the virtualenv.xyz as a virtualenv due to weirdness arising from the way I have 3.7 installed on the development vm. There are directions on how to use virtualenv that way in the doco but really it's not much different than if you installed it normally.

The target python is 3.7 which is installed at /usr/local/bin/python3.7 on the development vm.
